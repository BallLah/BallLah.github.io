Account Deletion Policy

At BallLah, we respect our users' privacy and provide mechanisms for users to control their personal information. This Account Deletion Policy outlines the procedure for users who wish to delete their accounts and associated personal information from our records.

Procedure for Account Deletion:

Request Submission: Users who wish to delete their accounts must submit a request via email to our support team at balllah2024@gmail.com. The request must include the following information:

Full Name
Email Address Associated with the Account
Username (if applicable)
Any Other Identifying Information (if applicable)
Verification: Upon receiving an account deletion request, we will verify the identity of the requester to ensure the security of personal information.

Deletion Process: Once the requester's identity is verified, we will proceed with the deletion of the account and associated personal information from our records. This process may involve removing the account details from our databases and any associated systems.

Confirmation: We will provide confirmation to the requester once the account deletion process is completed. Please note that while we strive to process account deletion requests promptly, it may take some time to complete the process due to technical constraints or legal obligations.

Impact of Account Deletion:

Upon deletion of the account, users will no longer have access to any services or features provided by BallLah associated with their account.
Deletion of the account is irreversible, and users may need to re-register or provide their information again if they wish to use our services in the future.
Exceptions:

We may retain certain personal information as required or permitted by law, such as for compliance with legal obligations or resolution of disputes.
Account deletion requests may be denied in cases where we are unable to verify the identity of the requester or where retention of the information is necessary for legitimate business purposes.
Contact Information:

If you have any questions or concerns about our Account Deletion Policy or wish to submit an account deletion request, please contact our support team at balllah2024@gmail.com.

Thank you for your understanding and cooperation in ensuring the protection of your privacy.
